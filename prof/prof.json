around the idea of executing programs in virtual time, which allows time dilation to be applied to components of an executing program, allowing the effect of bottleneck optimisations to be explored without modifying the code or supporting platform.\nHe is also interested in high-level languages, formalisms and tools that can be used to exploit the power of high-performance computer systems whilst reducing the software engineering burden.\n Related to this, he maintains a keen interest in the Haskell programming language and its application.\n"}
